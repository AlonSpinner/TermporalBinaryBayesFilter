Generally speaking:
	1) schedule holds probabilties p(m = occ | s,t)
	2) from posterior p(m|z,s,t) we may decide that a cell is occupied ~ 'finished task'
	3) to achieve 'multi-stage' we can 'clear' an occupied cell


Scenario1: Frozen World - Frozen Schedule - Binary Sensor:
	Setting: 
		*workers gone home for the day
		*we need to understand what was built during the day
		*we have a binary sensor that measures 'finished'/'not finished' status of a task in a cell

Frozen World - Changing Schedule - Binary Sensor
	Setting:
		* workers gone home
		* prehaps we can modify the schedule to fit reality...
		* this is a crapy setting

Changing World - Changing Schedule - Binary Sensor
	Setting:
		* workers are in the building
		* the robot does reconnaissance in the building --- LIFELONG SLAM
		* we have a binary sensor that measures 'finished'/'not finished' status of a task in a cell
		* we want to plan the schedule such that it will allow the robot to make verifications		
		* we may want to change the schedule if things were built in a less than optimized order
