Frozen World - Frozen Schedule - Binary Sensor:
	1) Setting: 
		*workers gone home
		*we need to understand what was built during the day
		*we have a binary sensor that measures 'finished'/'not finished' status of a task in a cell
	2) schedule holds probabilties p(m = occ | s,t)
	3) we are not expected to correct/override the schedule: 
		there is no "lessening" the probability of a cell being occupied beoynd schedule
	4) from posterior p(m|z,s,t) we may decide that a cell is occupied ~ 'finished task'
	5) to achieve 'multi-stage' we can 'clear' an occupied cell
